# Sprig Plugin for Craft CMS

### A reactive Twig component framework for Craft CMS.

Sprig is a free plugin for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) that allows you to create reactive components from Twig templates and/or PHP classes. These components can re-render themselves on user-triggered events (clicks, changes to input fields, form submissions, etc.) using AJAX requests, without requiring you to write a single line of JavaScript. 

Sprig enables common use-cases such as the following while completely avoiding full page refreshes:

- Live searching
- Loading more elements (with a button or infinite scroll)
- Pagination, ordering and filtering elements
- Adding products to a cart
- Submitting forms
